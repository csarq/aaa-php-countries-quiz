# 🌎 Country Fact Generator 🌎

Welcome to my Country Fact Generator! This is a personal project where I'm practicing my newly learnt PHP skills and applying web accessibility concepts I learned in the [Web Design Accessibility Certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-a794dfd1-6f13-49de-894d-57155c2d0041/).

**Live Demo:** [Link to deployed project, if available]()

## ✨ About the Project ✨

This project displays facts about different countries. Each time you click the "New Country" button, you'll get a random fact card showcasing a different nation.

The country data is fetched from the wonderful [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/), making this project a great way to practice working with external APIs.

## 🎯 Project Goals 🎯

* **PHP Basics:**  Get comfortable with fundamental PHP concepts like variables, arrays, loops, and functions.
* **API Interaction:** Practise fetching and parsing data from a RESTful API.
* **Accessibility:** Apply essential accessibility practices to make the fact cards usable for everyone.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack 🛠️

* **PHP:** The core language used to fetch data and generate the fact cards.
* **REST Countries API:** Provides a wealth of country information.
* **HTML, CSS:** Structure and style the fact cards.
* **JavaScript:**  Handle the button click event and update the fact card content.

## 🧠 Accessibility Focus 🧠

I'm striving to make these country fact cards as accessible as possible by:

* **Semantic HTML:** Using meaningful elements (headings, paragraphs, lists) to provide structure.
* **Color Contrast:** Choosing colors that ensure text is easy to read.
* **ARIA Attributes:**  Adding labels and descriptions to enhance screen reader experience.
* **Clear Presentation:** Formatting the information for easy comprehension. 

## 🤗 Feedback Welcome! 🤗

As I'm still learning, I value your feedback! Please feel free to open an issue or reach out if you have any suggestions or find any accessibility improvements I could make.

Let's learn about the world together! 😊
